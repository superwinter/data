16,Last winter vacation my family and I went to the beautiful desert named Death Valley.
18,"It got its name because it is a very dangerous desert to travel through.There is a story that a group of men, 12 I think, tried to cross the desert. Only a few made it and the rest died in the desert. So what makes Death Valley so dangerous? Death Valley,like to no water. If you do find water, don't drink it because it is poisonous and you'll die.This desert also has very dangerous temperature extremes."
19,"During the day the temperature can sky rocket up to over 45 degrees Calsius, while at night it can drop almost to freezing."

21,"Ghost towns in America may not be common, but there are a few.They got their name because everyone left the town and it appears strange. Imagine you are driving and find a small western town.

22,"You may wonder,""why are there no people?""The answer is very simple. America is very big and if explorers founded a town in a bad location,eventually no one would want to live there."
23,"In the old west,towns buil near rivers and railroads prospered and grew. Ones that were not,usually ""dried up and faded into the sun set."
24,"Today, however, tourism has broughy many of these back to life.it may sound strange, but people are interested in them."
